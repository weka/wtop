**WTOP** (WEKA TOP) is an open source, real-time **terminal user interface (TUI)** for monitoring **WEKA performance metrics** across frontend and backend hosts.  
It provides live CPU, IOPS, throughput, and latency information in a top-like display, making it easy to monitor cluster health directly from the command line.

## Features

- üñ•Ô∏è **Interactive TUI** using [urwid](https://urwid.org/)  
- üìä **Frontend & backend modes** for monitoring different host roles  
- ‚ö° Real-time stats:
  - CPU usage
  - IOPS (Ops/s, Reads/s, Writes/s)
  - Latency (read/write in microseconds)
- üìë Customizable columns  
- üöÄ Distributed as a **Python script** or as a **single-file binary**
